The ground station must be able to "monitor and controller [Tuppy]"
We will have many capabilities to monitor and control the boat as it is nearby, and a simple 3 boolean input system that can theoretically work up to 400m.

Simple (400m radio) inputs:
  0: If it is receiving from the boat (0 = true, 1=false)
  1: Is enabled
  2: Is manual or autonomous
  3: Do the batteries have good voltage

Simple (400m radio) outputs:
  0: Is transmitting (1=true, 0=false)
  1: Enable the boat
  2: Signal loop complete
  3: Do the batteries have good voltage

Advanced (WiFi) inputs:
  Kinect feed

Advanced (WiFi) outputs:
  Ability to change the code
